Dependencies

    Written based on the OpenGL 1.3 specification.

    NV_packed_depth_stencil affects the definition of this extension.

Overview

    This extension provides two-sided stencil testing where the
    stencil-related state (stencil operations, reference value, compare
    mask, and write mask) may be different for front- and back-facing
    polygons.  Two-sided stencil testing may improve the performance
    of stenciled shadow volume and Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG)
    rendering algorithms.

Issues

    Is this sufficient for shadow volume stencil update in a single pass?

      RESOLUTION:  Yes.

      An application that wishes to increment the stencil value for
      rasterized depth-test passing fragments of front-facing polygons and
      decrement the stencil value for rasterized fragments of depth-test
      passing back-facing polygons in a single pass can use the following
      configuration:

        glDepthMask(0);
        glColorMask(0,0,0,0);
        glDisable(GL_CULL_FACE);
        glEnable(GL_STENCIL_TEST);
        glEnable(GL_STENCIL_TEST_TWO_SIDE_EXT);

        glActiveStencilFaceEXT(GL_BACK);
        glStencilOp(GL_KEEP,            // stencil test fail
                    GL_KEEP,            // depth test fail
                    GL_DECR_WRAP_EXT);  // depth test pass
        glStencilMask(~0);
        glStencilFunc(GL_ALWAYS, 0, ~0);

        glActiveStencilFaceEXT(GL_FRONT);
        glStencilOp(GL_KEEP,            // stencil test fail
                    GL_KEEP,            // depth test fail
                    GL_INCR_WRAP_EXT);  // depth test pass
        glStencilMask(~0);
        glStencilFunc(GL_ALWAYS, 0, ~0);

        renderShadowVolumePolygons();

      Notice the use of EXT_stencil_wrap to avoid saturating decrements
      losing the shadow volume count.  An alternative, using the
      conventional GL_INCR and GL_DECR operations, is to clear the stencil
      buffer to one half the stencil buffer value range, say 128 for an
      8-bit stencil buffer.  In the case, a pixel is "in shadow" if the
      final stencil value is greater than 128 and "out of shadow" if the
      final stencil value is 128.  This does still create a potential
      for stencil value overflow if the stencil value saturates due
      to an increment or decrement.  However saturation is less likely
      with two-sided stencil testing than the conventional two-pass
      approach because front- and back-facing polygons are mixed together,
      rather than processing batches of front-facing then back-facing
      polygons.

      Contrast the two-sided stencil testing approach with the more
      or less equivalent approach using facingness-independent stencil
      testing:

        glDepthMask(0);
        glColorMask(0,0,0,0);
        glEnable(GL_CULL_FACE);
        glEnable(GL_STENCIL_TEST);

        glStencilMask(~0);
        glStencilFunc(GL_ALWAYS, 0, ~0);

        // Increment for front faces
        glCullFace(GL_BACK);
        glStencilOp(GL_KEEP,   // stencil test fail
                    GL_KEEP,   // depth test fail
                    GL_INCR);  // depth test pass

        renderShadowVolumePolygons();

        // Decrement for back faces
        glCullFace(GL_FRONT);
        glStencilOp(GL_KEEP,   // stencil test fail
                    GL_KEEP,   // depth test fail
                    GL_DECR);  // depth test pass

        renderShadowVolumePolygons();

      Notice that all the render work implicit
      in renderShadowVolumePolygons is performed twice with the
      conventional approach, but only once with the two-sided stencil
      testing approach.

    Should there be just front and back stencil test state, or should
    the stencil write mask also have a front and back state?

      RESOLUTION:  Both the stencil test and stencil write mask state
      should have front and back versions.

      The shadow volume application for two-sided stencil testing does
      not require differing front and back versions of the stencil write
      mask, but we anticipate other applications where front and back
      write masks may be useful.

      For example, it may be useful to draw a convex polyhedra such that
      (assuming the stencil bufer is cleared to the binary value 1010):

      1) front-facing polygons that pass the depth test set stencil bit 0

      2) front-facing polygons that fail the depth test zero stencil bit 1

      3) back-facing polygons that pass the depth test set stencil bit 2

      4) back-facing polygons that fail the depth test zero stencil bit 3

      This could be accomplished in a single rendering pass using:

        glStencilMask(~0);
        glStencilClear(0xA);
        glClear(GL_STENCIL_BUFFER_BIT);

        glDepthMask(0);
        glColorMask(0,0,0,0);
        glDisable(GL_CULL_FACE);
        glEnable(GL_STENCIL_TEST);
        glEnable(GL_STENCIL_TEST_TWO_SIDE_EXT);

        glActiveStencilFaceEXT(GL_BACK);
        glStencilOp(GL_KEEP,      // stencil test fail
                    GL_ZERO,      // depth test fail
                    GL_REPLACE);  // depth test pass
        glStencilMask(0xC);
        glStencilFunc(GL_ALWAYS, 0x4, ~0);

        glActiveStencilFaceEXT(GL_FRONT);
        glStencilOp(GL_KEEP,      // stencil test fail
                    GL_ZERO,      // depth test fail
                    GL_REPLACE);  // depth test pass
        glStencilMask(0x3);
        glStencilFunc(GL_ALWAYS, 0x1, ~0);

        renderConvexPolyhedra();

    Is there a performance advantage to using two-sided stencil testing?

      RESOLUTION:  It depends.

      In a fill-rate limited situation, rendering front-facing primitives,
      then back-facing primitives in two passes will generate the same
      number of rasterized fragments as rendering front- and back-facing
      primitives in a single pass.

      However, in other situations that are CPU-limited,
      transform-limited, or setup-limited, two-sided stencil testing can
      be faster than the conventional two-pass face culling rendering
      approaches.  For example, if a lengthy vertex program is executed
      for every shadow volume vertex, rendering the shadow volume with
      a single two-sided stencil testing pass is advantageous.

      Often applications using stencil shadow volume techniques require
      substantial CPU resources to determine potential silhouette
      boundaries to project shadow volumes from.  If the shadow volume
      geometry generated by the CPU is only required to be sent to the GL
      once per-frame (rather than twice with the conventional technique),
      that can ease the CPU burden required to implement stenciled shadow
      volumes.

    Should GL_FRONT_AND_BACK be accepted by glActiveStencilFaceEXT?

      RESOLUTION:  No.

      GL_FRONT_AND_BACK is useful when materials are being updated for
      two-sided lighting because the front and back material are often
      identical and may change frequently (glMaterial calls are allowed
      within glBegin/glEnd pairs).

      Two-sided stencil has no similiar performance justification.

      It is also likely that forcing implementations to support this mode
      would increase the amount of overhead required to set stencil
      state, even for applications that don't use two-sided stencil.

    How should the two-sided stencil enable operate?

      RESOLUTION:  It should be modeled after the way two-sided lighting
      works.  There is a GL_LIGHTING enable and then an additional
      two-sided lighting mode.  Unlike two-sided lighting which is a
      light model boolean, the two-sided stencil testing is a standard
      enable named GL_STENCIL_TEST_TWO_SIDE_EXT.

      Here is the pseudo-code for the stencil testing enables:

        if (glIsEnabled(GL_STENCIL_TEST)) {
          if (glIsEnabled(GL_STENCIL_TEST_TWO_SIDE_EXT) && primitiveType == polygon) {
            use two-sided stencil testing
          } else {
            use conventional stencil testing
          }
        } else {
          no stencil testing
        }

    How should the two-sided stencil interact with glPolygonMode?

      RESOLUTION:  Primitive type is determined by the begin mode
      so GL_TRIANGLES, GL_TRIANGLE_STRIP, GL_QUAD_STRIP, GL_QUADS,
      GL_TRIANGLE_FAN, and GL_POLYGON generate polygon primitives.  If the
      polygon mode is set such that lines or points are rasterized,
      two-sided stencil testing still operates based on the original
      polygon facingness if stencil testing and two-sided stencil testing
      are enabled.

      This is consistent with how two-sided lighting and face culling
      interact with glPolygonMode.

 -- Section 4.1.5 "Stencil test"

    Replace the first paragraph in the section with:

    "The stencil test conditionally discards a fragment based on the
    outcome of a comparison between the value in the stencil buffer at
    location (xw,yw) and a reference value.

    The test is enabled or disabled with the Enable and Disable commands,
    using the symbolic constant STENCIL_TEST.  When disabled, the stencil
    test and associated modifications are not made, and the fragment is
    always passed.

    Stencil testing may operate in a two-sided mode.  Two-sided stencil
    testing is enabled or disabled with the Enable and Disable commands,
    using the symbolic constant STENCIL_TEST_TWO_SIDE_EXT.  When stencil
    testing is disabled, the state of two-sided stencil testing does
    not affect fragment processing.

    There are two sets of stencil-related state, the front stencil
    state set and the back stencil state set.  When two-sided stencil
    testing is enabled, stencil tests and writes use the front set of
    stencil state when processing fragments rasterized from non-polygon
    primitives (points, lines, bitmaps, image rectangles) and front-facing
    polygon primitives while the back set of stencil state is used when
    processing fragments rasterized from back-facing polygon primitives.
    For the purposes of two-sided stencil testing, a primitive is still
    considered a polygon even if the polygon is to be rasterized as
    points or lines due to the current polygon mode.  Whether a polygon
    is front- or back-facing is determined in the same manner used for
    two-sided lighting and face culling (see sections 2.13.1 and 3.5.1).
    When two-sided stencil testing is disabled, the front set of stencil
    state is always used when stencil testing fragments.

    The active stencil face determines whether stencil-related commands
    update the front or back stencil state.  The active stencil face is
    set with:

      void ActiveStencilFace(enum face);

    where face is either FRONT or BACK.  Stencil commands (StencilFunc,
    StencilOp, and StencilMask) that update the stencil state update the
    front stencil state if the active stencil face is FRONT and the back
    stencil state if the active stencil face is BACK.  Additionally,
    queries of stencil state return the front or back stencil state
    depending on the current active stencil face.

    The stencil test state is controlled with

       void StencilFunc(enum func, int ref, uint mask);
       void StencilOp(enum sfail, enum dpfail, enum dppass);"

    Replace the third and second to the last sentence in the last
    paragraph in section 4.1.5 with:

    "In the initial state, stencil testing and two-sided stencil testing
    are both disabled, the front and back stencil reference values are
    both zero, the front and back stencil comparison functions are ALWAYS,
    and the front and back stencil mask are both all ones.  Initially,
    both the three front and the three back stencil operations are KEEP."

 -- Section 4.2.2 "Fine Control of Buffer Updates"

    Replace the last sentence of the third paragraph with:

    "The initial state is for both the front and back stencil plane mask
    to be all ones.  The clear operation always uses the front stencil
    write mask when clearing the stencil buffer."

 -- Section 4.3.1 "Writing to the Stencil Buffer or to the Depth and
    Stencil Buffers"

    Replace the final sentence in the first paragraph with:

    "Finally, each stencil index is written to its indicated location
    in the framebuffer, subject to the current front stencil mask state
    (set with StencilMask), and if a depth component is present, if the
    setting of DepthMask is not FALSE, it is also written to the
    framebuffer; the setting of DepthTest is ignored."
