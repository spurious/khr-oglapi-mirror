    The extension is written against the OpenGL 1.3 Specification.

Overview

    This extension provides the capability to query an OpenGL
    implementation for a preferred type and format combination
    for use with reading the color buffer with the ReadPixels
    command.  The purpose is to enable embedded implementations
    to support a greatly reduced set of type/format combinations
    and provide a mechanism for applications to determine which
    implementation-specific combination is supported.

Issues

*   Should this be generalized for other commands: DrawPixels, TexImage?

    Resolved: No need to aggrandize.

    Section 4.3 Drawing, Reading, and Copying Pixels

      Section 4.3.2 Reading Pixels

      (add paragraph)
      A single format and type combination, designated the
      preferred format, is associated with the state variables
      IMPLEMENTATION_COLOR_READ_FORMAT_OES and
      IMPLEMENTATION_COLOR_READ_TYPE_OES.  The preferred format
      indicates a read format type combination that provides optimal
      performance for a particular implementation.  The state values
      are chosen from the set of regularly accepted format
      and type parameters as shown in tables 3.6 and 3.5.
