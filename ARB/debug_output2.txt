There is no extension named GL_ARB_debug_group.

A specification using that name was posted in error during the initial
release of OpenGL 4.3. However, this was only an internal development
document and should not have been posted to the public registry. All
functionality related to debugging was folded into the extension
GL_KHR_debug_output.
